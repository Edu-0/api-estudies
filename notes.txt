Endpoint -> It's an end of a communication channel. In a normal URL we call it path, just like in my-website.com/delete-user, the "delete-user" is the endpoint/path

The most commons:

GET - Get an information
POST - Create something new
PUT - Update an information/data
DELETE - Delete that something

uvicorn myapi:app --reload
It's the basic command line to run the FastAPI project for the server

It'll be used two types of parameters: Path parameter and Query parameter

my-website.com/get-user -> The path parameter is the get-user. Here, we need to put the parameter directly on the URL with {user_id}
google.com/results?search=Python -> The query parameter is the "search=Python", we're giving a key and a value
