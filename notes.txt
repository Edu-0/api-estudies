Endpoint -> It's an end of a communication channel. In a normal URL we call it path, just like in my-website.com/delete-user, the "delete-user" is the endpoint/path

The most commons:

GET - Get an information
POST - Create something new
PUT - Update an information/data
DELETE - Delete that something
