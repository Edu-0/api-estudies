Endpoint -> It's an end of a communication channel. In a normal URL we call it path, just like in my-website.com/delete-user, the "delete-user" is the endpoint/path

The most commons:

GET - Get an information
POST - Create something new
PUT - Update an information/data
DELETE - Delete that something

uvicorn myapi:app --reload
It's the basic command line to run the FastAPI project for the server

It'll be used two types of parameters: Path parameter and Query parameter

my-website.com/get-user -> The path parameter is the get-user. Here, we need to put the parameter directly on the URL with {user_id}
google.com/results?search=Python -> The query parameter is the "search=Python", we're giving a key and a value

Request body and POST method

Request Body, from pydantic, can be thought as a template or schema for the data my API expects to store.
It defines fields, types and optional defaults.
When I send an input or want to save data, it gets checked and see if it matches to the structure, then it's converted to Python objects or JSON.
Summarizing: It's just a model to follow for making it easier to save.

"
def create_student(student_id: int, student : Student)
# student_id behaves like header/path input; student behaves like body
"

To Update safely, without overriding past values, just save the original object on a temporary, clean the unchanged values and pass the changed ones to the stored object and return it
